# Pipeline > Test+Analysis

For this milestone and project, you will continue to work in teams of 3 people.

## General Tasks

* Automatically configure a build environment and build job for a Java application (iTrust).
* Implement a test suite analysis for detecting useful tests.
* Implement a static analysis for detecting code smells.

### Project Driver

Extend your node.js project to support the following commands:

```bash
# Configure jenkins, build environments, build jobs
$ pipeline setup

# Trigger a build job (named iTrust), wait for output, and print build log.
$ pipeline build iTrust

# Initiate analysis of test suite for iTrust to run `-c` numbers of times.
# Output list of tests, ordered from most useful to least useful, based on the number of times 
# the test has detected a failed build.
$ pipeline useful-tests -c 100
90/100 edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.unit.action.GenerateCalendarActionTest.testGetApptsTable
80/100 edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.unit.report.DemographicReportFilterTest.testToString
70/100 edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.unit.action.AddPatientFileActionTest.testRequiredFieldMissing
10/100 edu.ncsu.csc.itrust.unit.model.officeVisit.OfficeVisitValidatorTest.testSetInvalidHospital
...

# Trigger a build job (named checkbox.io), wait for output, and print build log. 
# Static analysis should fail build job if any code smells are detected.
$ pipeline build checkbox.io

```



### üéõÔ∏è Automatically configure a build environment and build job for iTrust


##### Constraints

* Use bakerx as local provisioner for your VM (named "jenkins-srv").
* Assign static ip address 192.168.33.20 for jenkins server. 
* Use ansible for configuration. No credit given for use of ansible galaxy roles.
* Run jenkins server on port 9000.
* There is no required jenkins plugin; however, you will want to install anything that makes creating your build job easier.

### üõ†Ô∏èAutomatically configure a build environment (checkbox.io)

Create a build environment for [iTrust](https://github.ncsu.edu/engr-csc326-staff/iTrust2-v4), an "enterprise" Java system.

The production site has dependencies on nginx, node, monogodb, and additional environmental variable dependencies. However, the build environment will only need a subset of these.

* Install mongodb and nodejs.
* Create mongo user with password and `readWrite` role.
* Define `APP_PORT=3002`,`MONGO_PORT=27017`, `MONGO_USER=<user>`, `MONGO_PASSWORD=<pass>`, and `MONGO_IP=localhost`.

##### Constraints:

* Configure the environment to run on the same build server.
* You are free to construct the build environment for checkbox.io with any technology/tools, as long as it is done automatically.


### üìãCreate a build job.

The build job should perform the following build steps.

* Clone/checkout https://github.com/chrisparnin/checkbox.io
* Install npm modules.
* Start mongodb (if not already running as service).
* Start `server-side/site/server.js`.
* Successfully pass `npm test` (as provided in server-side/site/package.json)
* Tear down services.

##### Constraints:

* You cannot manually create the build job. You must use [jenkins-job-builder](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/) or [Jenkinsfile](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/).
  
## Team responsibilities

### üë• Task leaders 

Each major task should have a team member responsible for implementing the majority of the assigned task.

Use your GitHub Project Board (e.g. Milestone1) to help coordinate and assign tasks.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

### Checkpoint and milestone report.

##### Checkpoint

There will be two checkpoints where you will be required to report interim progress (CHECKPOINT.md).

* Checkpoint 1 due: 2/19
* Checkpoint 2 due: 2/26

Document your current progress and team contributions. Note work you have completed and what work will be done next. You may find it useful to take screenshots of your GitHub Projects.

_Points will be deducted for teams not making steady progress throughout the milestone._

##### Milestone report

As you learn how to setup configuration management for this project, document the experiences you have in learning about setting up the system and the issues you had in replicating this process automatically.

This can be described in your submission's README.md.

## Evaluation

* Automatically configure a jenkins server. (40%)
* Automatically configure a build environment. (20%)
* Create a build job. (20%)
* Checkpoint and milestone report. (10%)
* Screencast. (10%)

Points may be deducted for not following constraints, poor quality of implementation, poor task communication and delegation, or failing to include sufficient detail required to evaluate capabilities.

_Points will be deducted for non-contributing members, including receiving zero credit._

## Submission

Commit your all your work related to your project into your designated repository before the final deadline. Create a branch called `M1` to hold a snapshot of your work related to this milestone.

Ensure your repository contains:

* a top-level node.js project supporting the required commands for running your build server.
* a README.md, with your report details.
* a CHECKPOINT.md, with your two checkpoint reports.
* a link to screencast that demostrates each task.

**Due Wednesday, March 4th, before midnight.**
