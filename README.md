# DevOps: CSC 519
-------------------------

In this course, you will gain practical exposure to the skills, tools, and knowledge needed in automating software engineering processes and infrastructure necessary for continuous deployment of software. Students will have the chance to build new or extend existing software engineering tools and design an automated deployment pipeline.

## Course Overview

In the course, a mixture of traditional lectures with activities and in-class workshops will be used.  During lectures, we will cover core concepts related to a topic. During the in-class workshops, we will perform sample exercises with relevant tools that reinforce lecture material.  Evaluation will be based on tech talks, homework assignments, workshop attendance, and final project.

After the course, students are able to:

* Programmatically **provision** images.
* Automatically apply **configuration management** to production environments.
* Automatically create and maintain **build** environments.
* Maintain test suites and measure **testing quality** and coverage.
* Automatically **generate new tests**, using feedback-directed random testing, fuzzing, and data-flow analysis.
* Programmatically measure **code quality** via static and dynamic code analysis.
* Understand components of **infrastructure**.
* Remotely regulate behavior of deployed software via **feature flags** and configuration servers.
* Apply advanced strategies for **deployment** of software.
* Monitor and analyze **telemetry** data.
* Implement **resilience testing** on production environments (e.g., Chaos Monkey).

### Project

The primary objective of the course will be to allow students to gain experience in incrementally building a continous delivery pipeline from scratch.  Throughout the semester, students are expected to complete a component of the pipeline by each milestone deadline.

#### Milestones

Details on requirements for milestones will be released throughout the course.  A student's pipeline should demonstrate the following components by the milestone deadline:

[ CM ] -> [ BUILD+TEST+ANALYSIS ] -> [ DEPLOY ] -> [ SPECIAL ]
